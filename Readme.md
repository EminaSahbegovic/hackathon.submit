# Koding Global Virtual Hackathon Submission

## Description

I have choosen the first theme problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. Since I'm pretty much the noob lord I am not quite shure if I have nailed the theme. But I'm still really happy and almost overwhelmed by the amount of different skills I managed to learn during these 48 hours. Thank you for that.

## APIs used

I did not manage to use any APIs in my code :) (or at least I think I didn't)
